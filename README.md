# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Netflix-Data
Exploratory Analysis of Netflix entertainment data

The project focused on exploring and analyzing a dataset of Netflix titles and examining trends over time.

It involved data cleaning and manipulation using pandas, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.

The analysis revealed some interesting insights, including the fact that the number of TV show releases has surpassed the number of movie releases on Netflix in recent years, and that the duration of movies on Netflix has been decreasing over time.

This project also demonstrates proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Python, as well as an ability to draw meaningful insights from data.
